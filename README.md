Task Management System with Notifications (Backend in Laravel and Frontend in React.js)

1. Introduction
   The Task Management System with Notifications is a web-based application designed to
   facilitate task management and streamline communication by providing users with
   notifications for important task-related events. This document outlines the
   requirements, features, and implementation details for the project.
2. Project Overview
   2.1 Objective
   The objective of this project is to develop a task management system where users can
   perform CRUD operations on tasks and receive notifications for task-related events
   such as assignment, completion, or approaching deadlines. The system will utilize
   Laravel for the backend API and React.js (optional) for the frontend interface.
   2.2 Scope
   The scope of the project includes:
   Setting up a Laravel project for the backend API.
   Defining a Task model with CRUD operations.
   Implementing notifications using Laravel queues, events, and listeners.
   Providing optional frontend interface for users to interact with the system.
3. Functional Requirements
   3.1 Backend (Laravel)
   1. Task Management
      Implement CRUD operations for tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
      Define a Task model with fields: id, title, description, status,
      deadline.
      Implement RESTful API endpoints for task CRUD operations.
      Utilize Laravel Eloquent ORM for database interactions.
      Implement validation for task creation and updating.
4. Notification System
   Define events for task-related events (e.g., task assignment,
   completion, deadline approaching).
   Implement event listeners to trigger notifications for specific events.
   Integrate Laravel queues for asynchronous notification delivery.
   Implement notification channels (e.g., email) using Laravel's
   notification system.
   Ensure proper error handling and response formats (JSON) for API
   endpoints.
   3.2 Frontend (Vue JS)
5. User Interface

Create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the task
management system.
Implement CRUD functionality for tasks using React.js or any frontend
framework.
Integrate frontend interface with backend API for data retrieval and
manipulation.
3.3 General

1. Security
   Implement user authentication and authorization to restrict access to
   CRUD operations.
   Secure API endpoints against common security threats (e.g., CSRF, XSS).
2. Implementation Details
   Backend Framework: Laravel Latest Version
   Frontend Framework: React.js Latest Version
   Database: MySQL
   Notification Channels: Email
   Queue Driver: Redis or Database
3. Assignment Submissions
   After creating the project, upload the code to a GitHub repository, document
   the steps required to run the project, and include the GitHub link.
   Additionally, please share a recorded video demonstrating the functionality of
   the application.
